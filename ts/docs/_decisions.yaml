# _decisions.yaml - Decision trees for AppTheory TypeScript

decisions:
  choose_test_strategy:
    question: "How should I test handlers without AWS?"
    decision_tree:
      - condition: "You want deterministic tests and parity with contract fixtures."
        check: "Can you structure your code around AppTheory handlers?"
        if_yes:
          choice: "Use createTestEnv + build*Request helpers"
          reason: "Produces deterministic AWS-shaped events and responses."
          example: |
            // const env = createTestEnv({ now: new Date("2026-01-01Z") })
        if_no:
          choice: "Refactor to AppTheory handlers first"
          reason: "Testing gets easier once handlers are pure and portable."
