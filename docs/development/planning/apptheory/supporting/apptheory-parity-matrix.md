# AppTheory Multi-language Parity Matrix

This matrix tracks which features are implemented in Go/TypeScript/Python and which are fixture-backed by the runtime
contract tests.

Status: structure frozen for milestone `M0` (implementation statuses evolve as milestones land).

## Portable boundaries (P1/P2)

These are the P1/P2 capabilities that MUST remain portable across Go/TypeScript/Python (fixture-backed).

- **P1 portable core**
  - request-id creation/propagation and response header (`x-request-id`)
  - tenant extraction (`x-tenant-id` header, then `tenant` query param)
  - auth as a hook/interface (no hard-coded provider)
  - CORS origin echo + preflight handling
  - middleware ordering invariants (deterministic)
  - size/timeout guardrails (when configured)
  - `remaining_ms` surfaced to handlers (portable subset)
- **P2 portable core**
  - observability envelope via hooks (minimum log schema + stable metric/span naming rules where provided)
  - rate limiting semantics (portable subset; must map to `app.rate_limited` + deterministic `Retry-After` when known)
  - load shedding semantics (portable subset; must map to `app.overloaded` + deterministic `Retry-After` when known)

## Go-only boundaries (explicit)

These capabilities are explicitly allowed to be Go-only until they have a cross-language design + fixtures:

- provider-specific observability integrations (exporters, SDK wiring, OpenTelemetry SDK configuration)
- storage-backed rate limiting backends (DynamoDB/Redis/etc) beyond the portable contract (hook/middleware is portable)

## Tier definitions (portable surface area)

Tier definitions are the *portable* surface area. If it is in P0/P1/P2, it MUST be:

- specified in the runtime contract, and
- fixture-tested in `contract-tests/`, and
- implemented equivalently in Go/TypeScript/Python.

P0 / P1 / P2 tier definitions (frozen in `M0`, summarized here for quick reference):

- **P0 (Runtime core):** HTTP event adapters + routing + request/response normalization + error envelope + validation
  rules.
- **P1 (Context + middleware):** request-id, auth hooks, tenant extraction, CORS, size/time guardrails, middleware
  ordering.
- **P2 (Prod features):** observability (logs/metrics/traces), rate limiting / load shedding semantics, policy hooks,
  “safe by default” controls.

Source: `docs/development/planning/apptheory/apptheory-multilang-roadmap.md`

Default behavior:

- Default tier is **P2** across Go/TypeScript/Python. Use an explicit `p0` / `p1` tier when you want the minimal surface
  area.

## Allowed divergence (rare, explicit)

Portable semantics are the goal; “allowed to diverge” is intentionally narrow:

- **API shape may be idiomatic per language**, but MUST provide equivalent capabilities and MUST match the contract
  fixtures.
- **Implementation details may diverge** (libraries, concurrency primitives, etc.) as long as externally observable
  behavior matches fixtures.
- **Non-portable features MUST NOT hide in P0/P1/P2**. If a feature cannot be made portable, it MUST be listed in the
  Go-only section below with a clear boundary and doc link.
