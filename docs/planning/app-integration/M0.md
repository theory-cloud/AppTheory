# M0 — Version Consistency (AppTheory)

This file is the **work order** for an independent agent working in the `AppTheory` repo for milestone **M0** of the
`theory app` AppTheory/TableTheory integration effort.

## Goal

Ensure AppTheory’s stable release version and its TableTheory dependency version are consistent and suitable for GovTheory
pack pinning (“pin to the most recent release”).

## Context

GovTheory packs will be pinned to explicit versions:
- AppTheory stable pin (expected): `v0.5.0`
- TableTheory stable pin (expected): `v1.3.0`

AppTheory must not depend on an ambiguous / unreleased TableTheory version if we expect other repos to `go get` the pinned
tag successfully.

## Deliverables (this repo)

1) Confirm AppTheory stable version signals are consistent:
- `.release-please-manifest.json` (stable channel)
- `CHANGELOG.md` latest stable entry
- `go.mod` (should match the stable tag expectations for consumers)

2) Align AppTheory’s TableTheory dependency to the chosen TableTheory stable pin:
- Update `go.mod` requirement for `github.com/theory-cloud/tabletheory` if needed.
- Run `go mod tidy` if you changed `go.mod`.

3) Scan for hard-coded TableTheory version references in docs and update if they conflict with the chosen pin:
- At minimum, check:
  - `docs/getting-started.md`
  - `docs/migration/from-lift.md`
  - `CHANGELOG.md` (if it asserts a specific TableTheory version)

## Out of scope for M0 (do not do here)

- No runtime feature changes.
- No migration-guide rewrites.
- No CDK behavior changes.

## Validation / self-check

- `go test ./...` passes.
- `go.mod` references a TableTheory version that exists as a stable tag (per TableTheory M0 outcome).

## Handoff (what to report back)

- Confirmed AppTheory stable pinned version (e.g., `v0.5.0`).
- The TableTheory version AppTheory depends on after this work.
- Any conflicting version references you found and corrected (file paths).
