# AppTheory Supply-Chain Allowlist (SEC-3)
#
# Purpose: reduce false positives from heuristic supply-chain scanning without weakening the gate.
# This file is a plain-text allowlist of exact finding IDs emitted by `SEC-3` when running:
#   bash gov-infra/verifiers/gov-verify-rubric.sh
#
# Rules:
# - One ID per line.
# - `#` comments are allowed.
# - Keep this file versioned in git; treat allowlist changes as security-relevant.
# - Prefer fixing/removing the dependency over allowlisting. If you allowlist, include a justification comment.
#
# Example (copy from `gov-infra/evidence/SEC-3-output.log`):
# GOV-SUPPLY:NODE:SCRIPT:pkg=some-package:ver=1.2.3:hook=postinstall:rule=CURL_PIPE_SHELL
#
# Other examples:
# - Python:
#   GOV-SUPPLY:PYTHON:LINE:file=requirements.txt:rule=CUSTOM_INDEX:sha256=deadbeefcafe
# - Go:
#   GOV-SUPPLY:GO:REPLACE:rule=REMOTE_REPLACE:from=github.com/example/upstream@v1.2.3:to=github.com/example/fork@v1.2.3
